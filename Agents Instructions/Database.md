# Database Schema — מצב האומה

Reference doc for all Supabase tables. Covers what each table stores, where its data comes from, which fields matter, and how tables relate to each other. Read alongside [ProjectOverview.md](./ProjectOverview.md).

---

## Overview

The schema is split into four logical groups:

| Group | Tables | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Knesset** | `people` · `knessets` · `knesset_factions` · `knesset_memberships` | Live — powers the Knesset page |
| **Government** | `governments` · `offices` · `minister_appointments` | Seeded — dashboard page planned |
| **KPI data** | `indexes` · `index_data` | Seeded — dashboard page planned |
| **Elections** | `elections` · `election_parties` · `election_candidates` · `raw_candidate_lists` | In progress — elections page planned |

All data is populated and kept current by Python scripts in `Layer 1 - Gathering Data/`. The frontend uses only the public Supabase anon key and never writes to the DB.

## Knesset Group

### `people`

The central person record. Every MK, minister, and election candidate across all Knessets resolves to a row here.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `full_name` | text | Full Hebrew name — "FirstName LastName" format |
| `knesset_person_id` | integer | Official ID from the Knesset OData API (`KNS_Person.PersonID`). UNIQUE. Used as the stable cross-reference key. |
| `birth_date` | date | May be null — not all persons have it in the Knesset API |
| `gender` | text | `"זכר"` or `"נקבה"` — sourced directly from `KNS_Person.GenderDesc` |
| `image_url` | text | Photo URL — local path or Wikidata image |
| `email` | text | From Knesset OData |
| `twitter_handle` | text | Manual / Wikidata enrichment |
| `wikipedia_url` | text | Manual / Wikidata enrichment |
| `is_current` | boolean | Whether the person is a current MK — from `KNS_Person.IsCurrent` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** `sync_knesset_data.py` → Knesset OData `KNS_Person`. Enriched by `enrich_wikidata.py` for election candidates. Upserted on `knesset_person_id`.

**Notes:**
- `knesset_person_id` is null for persons created by the election pipeline (new candidates never in a Knesset). These rows are created by `resolve_candidates.py` with only `full_name` set.
- `gender` uses Hebrew labels directly — never mapped from a numeric ID. The Knesset API's `GenderID` values (250, 251, 252) are not meaningful; use `GenderDesc`.

---

### `knessets`

One row per Knesset term (הכנסת ה-1 through the current Knesset).

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `knesset_number` | integer | Knesset number (1–25+). UNIQUE. |
| `knesset_name` | text | Hebrew name, e.g. `"כנסת ה-25"` |
| `start_date` | date | Start of the Knesset term |
| `end_date` | date | End of term — null if active |
| `is_active` | boolean | True for the current Knesset |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** `sync_knesset_data.py` → Knesset OData `KNS_KnessetDates`. That entity stores individual plenum sessions (multiple rows per Knesset), so the sync script aggregates: `start_date = MIN(PlenumStart)`, `end_date = MAX(PlenumFinish)`, grouped by `KnessetNum`. The entity `KNS_Knesset` does not exist in the live API.

**Used by:** `knesset_memberships`, `knesset_factions`, `governments`. Frontend Knesset picker dropdown.

---

### `knesset_factions`

Parliamentary factions within a specific Knesset session. A faction is the post-election grouping of MKs — it may differ from the ballot party that ran in the election.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `knesset_faction_id` | integer | Official ID from `KNS_Faction.FactionID`. UNIQUE. |
| `knesset_id` | bigint | FK → `knessets.id` |
| `name` | text | Full faction name in Hebrew |
| `short_name` | text | Short display name — manually set, not from OData |
| `start_date` | date | When the faction formed |
| `end_date` | date | When it dissolved — null if current |
| `is_current` | boolean | True for active factions in the current Knesset |
| `is_coalition` | boolean | True if part of the governing coalition — manually maintained |
| `color` | text | Hex color for UI — manually set |
| `logo_url` | text | Party logo URL — manually set |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** `sync_knesset_data.py` → Knesset OData `KNS_Faction`. Upserted on `knesset_faction_id`. Fields NOT provided by the OData API and never overwritten by the sync: `color`, `logo_url`, `short_name`, `is_coalition`.

**Notes:**
- The sync script uses `FinishDate` (not `EndDate`) from the OData API.
- `is_coalition` must be maintained manually when government changes occur.
- Post-2026 election: linked to `election_parties` via `election_parties.knesset_faction_id`.

---

### `knesset_memberships`

Records each person's membership as an MK in a specific Knesset, within a specific faction.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `knesset_position_id` | integer | `KNS_PersonToPosition.PersonToPositionID`. UNIQUE. The OData primary key for this position record. |
| `person_id` | bigint | FK → `people.id` |
| `knesset_id` | bigint | FK → `knessets.id` |
| `faction_id` | bigint | FK → `knesset_factions.id` |
| `is_coalition` | boolean | Always `false` — not available from OData. Derive from `knesset_factions.is_coalition` instead. |
| `start_date` | date | When this membership started |
| `end_date` | date | When it ended — null if current |
| `duty_desc` | text | Role description from OData |
| `committee_role` | text | Committee role — rarely populated |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** `sync_knesset_data.py` → Knesset OData `KNS_PersonToPosition`, filtered to `PositionID IN (43, 61)`:
- `43` = חבר הכנסת (male MK) — confirmed from live `KNS_Position` table
- `61` = חברת הכנסת (female MK) — confirmed from live `KNS_Position` table

**Used by:** Frontend Knesset hemicycle. Also used by the election pipeline to determine "new MK" status — a candidate with no row here has never served.

**Notes:**
- `end_date` comes from `KNS_PersonToPosition.FinishDate` (not `EndDate`) in the OData API.

---

## Government Group

### `governments`

One row per Israeli government (ממשלה).

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `government_number` | integer | Official government number. UNIQUE. |
| `knesset_id` | bigint | FK → `knessets.id` — null in current data (see notes) |
| `start_date` | date | Government formation date — null in current data |
| `end_date` | date | Government end date — null in current data |
| `is_active` | boolean | True for the current government |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** `sync_knesset_data.py`. No `KNS_Government` endpoint exists in the Knesset OData API — government numbers are derived from unique `GovernmentNum` values in `KNS_PersonToPosition`. This means `knesset_id`, `start_date`, and `end_date` are currently null. The table exists primarily as an FK anchor for `minister_appointments`.

---

### `offices`

Government ministries (משרדי ממשלה).

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `knesset_category_id` | integer | `KNS_GovMinistry.GovMinistryID`. UNIQUE. |
| `knesset_category_name` | text | Ministry name as returned by OData |
| `name` | text | Display name in Hebrew |
| `name_en` | text | English name — not available from OData, null |
| `info` | text | Additional info — manually set |
| `logo_url` | text | Ministry logo — manually set |
| `news_feed_id` | text | RSS/news feed ID — manually set |
| `is_active` | boolean | Whether the ministry currently exists |
| `is_shown` | boolean | Whether to show on the dashboard |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** `sync_knesset_data.py` → Knesset OData `KNS_GovMinistry`. The OData entity does not have `NameEng` or `IsShown` fields — those are not populated by the sync.

---

### `minister_appointments`

Records each person's ministerial appointment in a specific government.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `knesset_position_id` | integer | `KNS_PersonToPosition.PersonToPositionID`. UNIQUE. |
| `person_id` | bigint | FK → `people.id` |
| `government_id` | bigint | FK → `governments.id` |
| `office_id` | bigint | FK → `offices.id` |
| `start_date` | date | Appointment start |
| `end_date` | date | Appointment end — null if current |
| `is_current` | boolean | Whether currently serving |
| `is_acting` | boolean | Always `false` — not available from OData |
| `duty_desc` | text | Role description from OData |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** `sync_knesset_data.py` → Knesset OData `KNS_PersonToPosition`, filtered to rows where both `GovernmentNum` and `GovMinistryID` are non-null (ministerial roles).

**Notes:**
- `end_date` comes from `FinishDate` (not `EndDate`) in the OData API.
- `GovernmentNum` (not `GovNum`) is the correct OData field name for the government number.

---

## KPI Data Group

### `indexes`

KPI definitions attached to a government office. Each index defines one trackable metric (e.g. unemployment rate, crime statistics).

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `office_id` | bigint | FK → `offices.id` |
| `name` | text | Metric name in Hebrew |
| `info` | text | Explanation of the metric |
| `icon` | text | Icon identifier for the UI |
| `is_kpi` | boolean | Whether to show as a headline KPI |
| `alert` | boolean | Whether to highlight this metric |
| `chart_type` | text | Default: `"line"`. Drives frontend chart selection. |
| `source` | text | Data source attribution |
| `is_shown` | boolean | Whether to show on the dashboard |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** Manually curated. No automated sync.

---

### `index_data`

Time-series data points for each index.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `index_id` | bigint | FK → `indexes.id` |
| `label` | text | Display label for this data point (e.g. `"ינואר 2025"`) |
| `value` | bigint | The metric value |
| `recorded_at` | date | When this value was recorded |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** Manually curated or automated per index source. No central sync script yet.

---

## Elections Group

### `elections`

One row per election event. Currently holds a single row for the 2026 election.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `year` | integer | Election year. UNIQUE. |
| `date` | date | Election day |
| `name` | text | Display name, e.g. `"בחירות לכנסת ה-26"` |
| `knesset_number` | integer | Which Knesset this election seats |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** Manually inserted via seed SQL. One row, rarely changes.

---

### `election_parties`

Parties running on the ballot in a given election. Separate from `knesset_factions` — ballot parties can merge or split after the election, so these are tracked independently.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `election_id` | bigint | FK → `elections.id` |
| `knesset_faction_id` | bigint | FK → `knesset_factions.id` — **null before the election**, wired post-election by `link_factions.py` |
| `name` | text | Full name, e.g. `"הליכוד בראשות בנימין נתניהו"` |
| `short_name` | text | Short lookup key used by pipeline, e.g. `"הליכוד"` |
| `color` | text | Hex color for UI |
| `logo_url` | text | Party logo URL |
| `ballot_letter` | text | Hebrew ballot symbol — null until Elections Committee certifies lists |
| `description` | text | Party description |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** Manually inserted when parties are confirmed. `short_name` is critical — it is what `insert_raw_list.py` and the pipeline use to look up parties. Run `python insert_raw_list.py --list-parties` to see available keys.

---

### `election_candidates`

Ordered candidate list per party. One row per candidate per party.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `election_id` | bigint | FK → `elections.id` |
| `party_id` | bigint | FK → `election_parties.id` |
| `person_id` | bigint | FK → `people.id` |
| `list_position` | integer | Position on the party list (1 = top) |
| `description` | text | 2-sentence Hebrew bio — generated by OpenAI pipeline |
| `city` | text | City of residence — from Wikidata or party publication |
| `latitude` | numeric | Geocoded from `city` via Nominatim |
| `longitude` | numeric | Geocoded from `city` via Nominatim |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Constraints:**
- `UNIQUE (party_id, list_position)` — no duplicate positions within a party
- `UNIQUE (party_id, person_id)` — same person can't appear twice on one list

**Data source:** Written by `resolve_candidates.py` (Stage 1 of the election pipeline). Enriched by `enrich_wikidata.py`, `generate_descriptions.py`, and `geocode_cities.py`. Never written directly.

**Stats computed at query time from this table:**

| Stat | Logic |
|------|-------|
| Average age | `AVG(DATE_PART('year', AGE(p.birth_date)))` joined to `people` |
| % women | `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p.gender = 'נקבה')` / total |
| % new MKs | `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM knesset_memberships WHERE person_id = ec.person_id))` / total |
| Map pins | `ec.latitude`, `ec.longitude` |

**Frontend read access:**

The elections frontend uses the public anon key. `elections`, `election_parties`, and `election_candidates` must be selectable by `anon`; otherwise the service-role pipeline can see rows while `/elections` renders an empty list.

```sql
alter table public.elections enable row level security;
alter table public.election_parties enable row level security;
alter table public.election_candidates enable row level security;

grant select on public.elections to anon;
grant select on public.election_parties to anon;
grant select on public.election_candidates to anon;

create policy "Public read elections"
on public.elections
for select
to anon
using (true);

create policy "Public read election parties"
on public.election_parties
for select
to anon
using (true);

create policy "Public read election candidates"
on public.election_candidates
for select
to anon
using (true);
```

---

### `raw_candidate_lists`

Staging table. The only place where data is inserted manually. The election pipeline reads from here and writes to `election_candidates`.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `election_id` | bigint | FK → `elections.id` |
| `party_id` | bigint | FK → `election_parties.id` |
| `raw_name` | text | Candidate name exactly as published by the party |
| `list_position` | integer | Position on the list |
| `raw_city` | text | City if the party published it — optional |
| `processed` | boolean | `false` on insert, flipped to `true` by the pipeline after the candidate is committed to `election_candidates` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp |

**Data source:** Written by `insert_raw_list.py` from a `.txt` or `.csv` file. Re-inserting a party's list deletes existing `processed=false` rows for that party and replaces them. Rows with `processed=true` are never deleted automatically.

**Pipeline trigger:** The pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`) picks up all rows where `processed=false` and processes them through four stages: name resolution → Wikidata enrichment → description generation → geocoding.

---

## Sync Scripts

| Script | Tables updated | Trigger |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `sync_knesset_data.py` | `knessets` · `people` · `knesset_factions` · `knesset_memberships` · `offices` · `governments` · `minister_appointments` | Weekly (GitHub Actions) |
| `insert_raw_list.py` | `raw_candidate_lists` | Manual — when a party publishes their list |
| `run_pipeline.py` | `election_candidates` · `people` (enrichment) | Manual — after each `insert_raw_list.py` run |
| `link_factions.py` | `election_parties.knesset_faction_id` | Post-election — once per election |

All sync writes are upserts. No script deletes data except `insert_raw_list.py` which removes `processed=false` rows for a party when re-inserting an updated list.
